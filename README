zeno - compiler
===============

Big Ideasâ„¢
----------

* A statically typed Lisp-like systems programming language.
* One level of implicit parentheses per line.
* Indentation-aware parsing reduces grouping parentheses.
* Small amount of builtins (they start with $).
* Code is data, Types are data: pass around, modify, pass back.
* Allow the user to create their own "standard library" without any external imports.
* All programs can/should be freestanding.
* Zero is initialization.
* The user will be given the path to the compiler at compile time.
* Compile-time variables modify what code is generated throughout interpretation of the program and are compiled out of the native executable.

Requirements
------------

* c99 compiler
